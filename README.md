## How to get started with Open Source

Here's a quick run down on how to get started with open source, first of all let's know some basic terminologies:

- Git: is a versioning system that let's you store your code and code history on your local computer preventing loses and allowing sharing of that code
- Github: is a server that let's you store the history in a database
- Open Source: A project is said to be open sourced if you can see the code on GitHub
- Fork: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub, it gets added to your repositories
- Repository: A project on GitHub is called a repository
- Pull Request: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project, this consists of you editing a file in the project.
- Issue: An issue is a change that should be done in a project, can be a bug, a new feature or a suggestion to a project
- Branch: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace(main or master), it allows you to work on something without affecting the original code.
- Star: When you star a repositiory, it gets saved at your profile and you can easily re-visit it later.

Now you know some basic terms, let's get into how to get started with some resources to let you understand open source better:

## Contributing

**I heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards! :raised_hands:**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope—it's our entire product.

* Contributions make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
* Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.
* Check out our contribution guidelines for more information.


## Don't forget to leave a star✨
# HAPPY CONTRIBUTING!!



## 🥂 After making a change
---
1. Create a new branch
```
git checkout -b YourBranchName
```
2. Add it to staging area
```
git add <path to the file you worked on>
```
3. Commit your changes with
```
git commit -m "message"
```
4. Push your changes
```
git push
```

## Rules

- **No `console.log`s in any file**: We use the `debug` module across the codebase to log debugging information in development only. Never commit a file that contains a `console.log` as CI will fail your build. The only exceptions are errors, which you can log, but you have to use `console.error` to be explicit about it
- **Code reviews**: All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.



### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on the website or have ideas for features we should implement, the issue tracker is the best place to share your ideas.  ([click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/Kritika30032002/Top_Secrets/issues))
