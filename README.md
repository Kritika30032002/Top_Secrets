## How to get started with Open Source

Here's a quick run down on how to get started with open source, first of all let's know some basic terminologies:

- Git: is a versioning system that let's you store your code and code history on your local computer preventing loses and allowing sharing of that code
- Github: is a server that let's you store the history in a database
- Open Source: A project is said to be open sourced if you can see the code on GitHub
- Fork: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub, it gets added to your repositories
- Repository: A project on GitHub is called a repository
- Pull Request: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project, this consists of you editing a file in the project.
- Issue: An issue is a change that should be done in a project, can be a bug, a new feature or a suggestion to a project
- Branch: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace(main or master), it allows you to work on something without affecting the original code

Now you know some basic terms, let's get into how to get started with some resources to let you understand open source better:

- [A complete Guide to Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE) - Video

## Contributing

**I heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards! :raised_hands:**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope‚Äîit's our entire product.

## Rules

- **No `console.log`s in any file**: We use the `debug` module across the codebase to log debugging information in development only. Never commit a file that contains a `console.log` as CI will fail your build. The only exceptions are errors, which you can log, but you have to use `console.error` to be explicit about it
- **Code reviews**: All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.



### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on the website or have ideas for features we should implement, the issue tracker is the best place to share your ideas.  ([click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/Kritika30032002/Top_Secrets/issues))

### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

- If you find a bug on Project and open a PR that fixes it we'll review it as soon as possible to ensure it matches our engineering standards.
- If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss what it'd look like .
- If you want to contribute but are unsure to start, we have [a "good first issue" label](https://github.com/Kritika30032002/Top_Secrets/contribute) which is applied to newcomer-friendly issues and pick something you like!
- Want to fix a bug or implement an agreed-upon feature? Great, jump to the [local setup instructions](#first-time-setup)!
